IAM


AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources.
 You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources

When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account.
 This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. 
We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using 
the root user only to create your first IAM user. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service
 management tasks.

Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an authorization strategy that defines permissions based on attributes. In AWS, these attributes are called tags. 
Tags can be attached to IAM principals (users or roles) and to AWS resources. You can create a single ABAC policy or small set of policies for your IAM principals.
 These ABAC policies can be designed to allow operations when the principal's tag matches the resource tag. ABAC is helpful in environments that are growing rapidly 
and helps with situations where policy management becomes cumbersome.

For example, you can create three roles with the access-project tag key. Set the tag value of the first role to Heart, the second to Sun, and the third to Lightning. 
You can then use a single policy that allows access when the role and the resource are tagged with the same value for access-project. For a detailed tutorial that 
demonstrates how to use ABAC in AWS, see Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control in AWS.
